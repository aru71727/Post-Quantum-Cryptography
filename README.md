Quantum key distribution:


The aim of quantum key distribution is to allow Alice and Bob to generate a secure private key
that can be used for the one-time pad without having to meet privately. They will be able to
accomplish this task by using quantum information. There are a few different schemes for doing
this, and among them one  of them is:
BB84,which is Easy to implement, relatively hard to prove security.
